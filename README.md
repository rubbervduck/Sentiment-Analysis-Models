Machine Learning Models   
Model 1 : Logistic Regression Accuracy of 94.06% (often ovefits so we implemented SVM)

Model 2 : Logistic Regression with Supervised Machine Learning Accuracy 85.04%

Deep Learning Model 
Model 1 : Uses simple feedforward architecture with an Embedding layer followed by GlobalAveragePooling1D and Dense layers.

Transformer Based Models 
Model 1 : Using BERT, R&D phase 

Pre Trained Model Vader
Model 1 :  To Compare Results with self trained models
